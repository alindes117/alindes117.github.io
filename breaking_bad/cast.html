        <p>The main cast members are Brian Cranston as Walter H. White, Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, Anna Gunn as Walter’s wife Skylar, Dean Noris as the DEA agent and RJ Mittle as Walter and Skylar’s son. Walter is a chemistry genius but works as a chemistry teacher in an Albequerque, New Mexico high school. His life drastically changes when he's diagnosed with stage III terminal lung cancer and not given much time to live - a matter of months. To ensure his handicapped son and his pregnant wife have a financial future, Walt uses his chemistry background to create and sell the world's finest crystal methamphetamine. But to sell it, he teams up with Jesse Pinkman - a former student of his. The meth makes them very rich very quickly, but it attracts the attention of his DEA brother in law Hank. As Walt and Jesse's status in the drug world escalates, Walt becomes a dangerous criminal, Jesse becomes a hot-headed salesman, while Hank is hot on his tail, and it forces Walt to come up with new ways to cover his tracks.</p>
