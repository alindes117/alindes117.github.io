    <h2>A Note From Our Coffee Traveler</h2>
    <p style="font-family: verdana;">As the fellow who travels the globe in search of the finest coffees to be found, I have a deep and personal connection to each of our coffees. More importantly, I have made a connection to the people and the lands that produce those wonderful coffees. For over 10 years it has been the coffee department's charge to develop and maintain relationships with the people at the beginning of our coffee supply chain. Those people are the farmers and the exporters in each country of origin. Unlike our company's size might suggest, we are not operating anonymously in purchasing our coffee. Instead, we have cultivated long-term relationships that are influencing and impacting entire families and communities around the globe.</p>
